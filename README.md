# Alter Engine
## What?
**Alter Engine** is a shitty engine I made as an experiment, if you want to use it, give proper credits.

## Compiling

**DO NOT** try to compile this out-of-box, this requires **vcpkg**.

To compile, edit the **Additional Library Directories** and **Additional Include Directories** in the project to lead to your **vcpkg** directory.

Required **vcpkg** libraries:
- SDL2
- Dear ImGui (*imgui[core,sdl2-binding,opengl3-binding]*)

### MAKE SURE TO GET THE DYNAMIC ONES!!!
